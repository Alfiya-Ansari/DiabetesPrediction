# Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. The implementation is done in Python and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on features like glucose levels, BMI, and more.

## Dataset Description

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function representing the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Outcome**: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

The dataset contains 768 entries, with some missing or zero values for certain features.

## Project Workflow

The notebook follows the steps below:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset and examine its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or invalid values (e.g., zeros in BMI, BloodPressure).
   - Normalize or scale the data if required.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze feature distributions and relationships.
   - Visualize the data using plots.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
   - Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction**:
   - Test the trained model on new data.

```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd diabetes-prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook diabetes-prediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Explore the dataset.
